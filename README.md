## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
  JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I had practiced flexbox even more. I also learnt how to fetch data from a .json file and use it in the HTML document through JavaScript.

```javascript
fetch(data.json)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then(data =>{
    // do something with data
})
```

### Continued development

I would like to practice responsive design even further using flexbox and grid and would also like to gain more knowledge on JavaScript.
